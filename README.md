# VigenereCipherDecoder

Description
This Python project implements a Vigenere Cipher decoder that provides encryption and decryption functionalities using a customizable key. The Vigenere cipher is a classic method of encrypting and decrypting messages with a polyalphabetic substitution technique.

Features
Encryption: Encrypt messages with a user-defined key.
Decryption: Decrypt Vigenere ciphered messages with the correct key.
Customizable: Input your own text and encryption key for experimentation.

Programming Skills Used
Python: The entire project is implemented in Python, showcasing skills in string manipulation, loops, conditional statements, and function definition.
Algorithmic Thinking: The project involves implementing the Vigenere Cipher algorithm for both encryption and decryption, demonstrating algorithmic problem-solving skills.
Git: The README suggests version control using Git for managing the project.

Usage
Set the text variable to the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Set the custom_key variable to your desired encryption key.
Run the script to see the encrypted and decrypted messages.

Feel free to experiment with different messages and keys to explore the functionality of the Vigenere Cipher Decoder!
